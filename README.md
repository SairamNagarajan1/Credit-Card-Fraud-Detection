> ✅ High accuracy and precision, but recall suggests some frauds still get missed — classic case of class imbalance!

---

## 📈 What I Learned

- The importance of **precision & recall over raw accuracy** in fraud detection
- How to use **confusion matrices** and **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**
- Why **imbalanced data** requires special attention in real-world ML problems

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Implement **SMOTE** or **undersampling** to handle imbalance better
- Compare **Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM**
- Try **autoencoder-based anomaly detection**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, metrics, train_test_split)
